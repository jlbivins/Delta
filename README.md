# ODS Full Stack Coding Assignment

## Assignment

Create a web application that allows a user to search for flights and display the results in a tabular view. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular. I choose localhost:3001 for the backend server.

## Features

1. The user is allowed to input the destination city and state in the user interface, ie:
Nashville
Tennessee.

The input is then captured in the 'Get' object along with placeholders for the departure & arrival
times to be implemented for the Mongo database. Gets are to be used for the query t o the Mongo dB
to return times for the user specified city. One of the two RESTful endpoints was coded, app.use('/api/gets',(req, res, next) => {const gets = [.... to route to route the get to the MongoDB
 
2. Provide an auto-suggest feature for station.

3. Provide two RESTful endpoints supporting the functionality listed in steps 1 and 2.

## Datasource

A zipped CSV file of flights is available in /data/flights.csv. Each row in the CSV file represents a flight.

## Implementation
I attempted to use MEAN stack. One server was implemented
